# EMUFI Training Set Collection
This repository contains pages from selected manuscripts, along with their typed transcription (ground truth), to serve as a training set for OCR systems. The collection has been developed to train systems (in particular [Transkribus](https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/)) to recognize symbols unique to the Geʾez manuscript tradition such as bichromatic punctuation and numerals, ligatures, character and punctuation variants, and specialized marks.

The transcribed documents in the collection use the [EMUFI](https://github.com/geezorg/emufi/) assigned addresses for the non-standard symbols.  It is also the goal of the training set to develop an OCR model that targets the EMFUI encoding.

## Collections
Manuscripts and sample pages have been selected that provide a variety of the non-standard manuscript symbols that have been previously surveyed for the EMUFI project. The manuscripts samples in the collection and summarized in the following:
